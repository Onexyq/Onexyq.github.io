Welcome to my personal blog! I'm a graduate student at the University of Southern California, majoring in computer science. My journey in technology has been fueled by a deep passion for web applications, infrastructure software, and the fascinating realm of AI.

One of my core beliefs is that writing high-quality code is essential. I strive to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code because I know it forms the backbone of any successful software project. From my experience, I've seen how good code can significantly improve a system's performance and make it easier to maintain.

I also believe that problem-solving is best done collaboratively. My strong communication and interpersonal skills have helped me work effectively in teams, bridging the gap between complex technical details and the needs of end-users. I find great satisfaction in not only tackling technical challenges but also ensuring that the solutions align with the project's overall goals.

I'm excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in my computer science career. I look forward to using my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions and contribute positively to the field. Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you enjoy following along with my journey!
