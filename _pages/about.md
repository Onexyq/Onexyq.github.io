 I’m Yiqi Xue, a first-year graduate student at the University of Southern California (USC) majoring in computer science. My journey in the world of technology has been marked by a passion for web application development, infrastructure softwares, and the fascinating realm of databases.

My professional experiences at Huawei Technologies as a database developer and at WellinTech as a backend software engineer have been instrumental in shaping my skills and perspectives. While at Huawei, I delved into the intricacies of database kernal, where I honed my expertise in designing and optimizing data solutions. At WellinTech, my role as a backend engineer allowed me to contribute to the development of robust systems and applications, cementing my commitment to the field of backend development.

One of my core values is a dedication to writing high-quality code. I believe that clean, efficient, and well-documented code is the foundation of a successful software project. My experiences have reinforced my commitment to this principle, as I’ve seen firsthand how code quality impacts the performance and maintainability of a system.

Furthermore, I view problem-solving as a collaborative endeavor. My strong communication and interpersonal skills have enabled me to work effectively within teams, bridging the gap between technical intricacies and the needs of end-users. I find great satisfaction in not only identifying and resolving technical challenges but also in ensuring that the solutions I provide meet the broader objectives of the projects I’m involved in.

I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead in my career in computer science, and I look forward to applying my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions and contribute positively to the field.
